    "Even after the 2022/2023 soccer season was over, I had a burning desire to do a pet project and analyze the data from the current season. For a long time I delayed this moment and could not even imagine that by the beginning of August the data for the last season would simply not be freely available on the Internet. Therefore, I decided to work with Internet data on my own, in particular, to learn how to use web scraping and collect data for scientific and research purposes\n",

I initially relied on this author's __[notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/slehkyi/web-scraping-football-statistics-per-game-data/notebook)__, for which I thank him very much, and also supplemented it with other data from site. \n",
